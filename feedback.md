1. The the commit message of week 3 was not that informative. I tried to make it clearer to see the changes I had done. If the commit message is informative, it can help us remember what changes we have done and help us improve the code.
2. The intepretion of the mistery code in week 4 was not accurate as the output is not a guess. It exactly shows the times it take to get to the correct number.
